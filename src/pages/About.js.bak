            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
              Linear Algebra Studio was developed through careful planning and iterative implementation. 
              We started with a vision to create an intuitive platform for learning linear algebra, 
              and gradually built each component while constantly refining the user experience through
              user feedback and testing.

            <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>
              Linear algebra is fundamental to many fields including computer graphics, machine learning, 
              data science, and engineering. However, understanding these concepts can be challenging 
              without proper visualization tools. Linear Algebra Studio addresses this need by providing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interactive visualization of abstract concepts</li>
              <li>Real-time computation and feedback</li>
              <li>Intuitive interface for experimentation</li>
              <li>Practical examples from various fields</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
